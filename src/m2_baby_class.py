# TODO: 2.
#
#  Step 2a:  Implement a class called   Baby   that has a constructor method
#            (__init__) and two other methods, as described below.
#
#  Step 2b:  Test your finished   Baby   class by running this module.
#            Your code passes the test if it displays exactly the output
#            shown in the doc_string for main.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Here (below) are the methods that you must implement in your Baby class:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Constructor method (__init__)
#     What comes in:
#        -- self
#        -- a string for the name of the baby
#     What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#     Side effects:
#        -- Sets instance variables as needed [YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IS NEEDED!]
#        -- Prints 'Hello baby <your baby's name>!'
#     Example:
#         b = Baby('McKinley')   causes the following to be printed:
#               Hello baby McKinley!
#
# feed_baby
#     What comes in:
#        -- self
#     What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#     Side effects:
#        -- Prints 'Thank you for feeding baby <your baby's name>.'
#        -- Modifies instance variables as needed
#     Example:
#         b = Baby('Joshua')
#         b.feed_baby()         causes the following to be printed:
#               Hello baby Joshua!
#               Thank you for feeding baby Joshua.
#
# hour_passes
#     What comes in:
#        -- self
#     What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#     Side effects:
#      -- If this is the FIRST time this method has been called
#         since this Baby was created or last fed, then this method prints:
# 	             'Baby <your baby's name> is sleeping.'
#
#      -- If this is the SECOND time this method has been called
#         since baby was created or last fed, then this method prints:
# 	             'Baby <your baby's name> is awake.  Time for food.'
#
#      -- If this is the THIRD (OR MORE) time this method has been called
#           since baby was created or last fed, then this method prints:
#         'Baby <your baby's name> is CRYING uncontrollably!  Feed the Baby!'
